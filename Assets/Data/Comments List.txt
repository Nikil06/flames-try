#------------------------------------------*FRIENDS COMMENTS*------------------------------------------^
Oh great, now you get to deal with the drama of friend breakups instead of just regular breakups.^

Friends? But who will you complain to about your love life now?^
Friends? What a boring result. I was hoping for something juicier.^

There's nothing better than finding someone who makes you feel like you're on top of the world. Wishing you both a lifetime of love and happiness.^
When you find the one you're meant to be with, everything falls into place. Congrats on finding your person.^

#------------------------------------------*AFFECTIONATE COMMENTS*------------------------------------------^
Looks like the flames of passion haven't been lit yet, just some sparks of affection.^
Affection? You might as well be siblings.^
If this were a race, you two would be at a snail's pace.^
Wow, congratulations, you have the emotional depth of a Disney Channel original movie.^
Affection? That's almost as exciting as watching paint dry.^
I'm sure the sparks are flying... somewhere else.^
Affection is a great foundation for a relationship. Keep building on it and who knows where it might go.^
Aww, affection is a beautiful thing. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.^
Sometimes it's the small things, like affection, that make a big difference in a relationship.^
I'm pretty sure my calculator has more chemistry than these two names.^
Why even bother with the flames when you could just light a candle for this level of affection?^
Let's be real, F.L.A.M.E.S. is just an excuse to say silly things about your crush without being too obvious.^

Marriage? Let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we?^
Don't worry, even the best marriages have their ups and downs. Mostly downs, but still.^

When it comes to marriage, communication is key. Make sure you're always talking to each other.^
Marriage isn't easy, but it can be worth it. Wishing you both a lifetime of love and happiness.^
Marriage? You're not even dating yet!^
Let's be real, half of marriages end in divorce anyway.^
Why bother with the flames when you could just swipe right on a dating app?^
#------------------------------------------*ENEMIES COMMENTS*------------------------------------------^
Enemies? More like frenemies. Who knows, you might end up bonding over your shared hatred for each other.^
Well, every good rom-com needs a good antagonist. You're just fulfilling that role.^
Enemies? Looks like you have some unresolved tension. Don't worry, we won't ask for details.^
Enemies? How thrilling. Nothing like a little hostility to keep things interesting.^
Enemies? Congratulations, you've officially become your own worst nightmare.^
Enemies? Just remember, revenge is a dish best served cold.^
Sometimes relationships start off rocky, but with time and effort, they can be repaired. Wishing you both the best.^
Being enemies can be tough, but it can also be an opportunity to learn and grow from each other.^
Just because you're enemies now doesn't mean it has to stay that way forever. Keep an open mind and heart.^
Enemies? More like two people who just need to work on their communication skills.^
Don't worry, it's just a game. You don't have to actually hate each other... unless you want to, of course.^
Let's be real, F.L.A.M.E.S. is just a silly way to pass the time. Don't take it too seriously.^

Siblings can be the best friends you'll ever have. Treasure your bond and all the memories you'll make.^
Family is forever, and that bond can be unbreakable. Embrace it and cherish it always.^
